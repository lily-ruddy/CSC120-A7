- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I didn't realize until just about submitting that I overloaded constructors and not methods for this homework. I'll make sure to rectify this with a revision after the deadline has passed. The only one that I overloaded a method was for the Cafe method of selling coffee. I made it so that the cafe can sell a "regular" cup of coffee without explicitly listing out the items needed to make it. It becomes annoying quick when you have to list the items everytime you want to sell a coffee. 

I liked the overloading. It seems so simple because all you have to do is put the method inside your class and make modifications.
